## Getting Started

### Install via Package Manager

1. Open the Package Manager window in Unity
2. Click the "`+`" button in the top left corner and select "`Add package from git URL...`"
3. Enter the value "`https://github.com/Talsidor/Hierarchy-Icons.git`"
4. Hierarchy Icons should now be installed!

## Settings

Note: Hierarchy Icons' Settings are saved only for the local user (via Editor Prefs), so that different users in the same project can have different configurations.

### Set level

1. In your Unity Editor's top menu, navigate to `Tools > Hierarchy Icons > Set Level to...`
2. The current option will have a tick next to it, select a different level to change whether Hierarchy Icons are shown for:
  a. All Components,
  b. just Components that inherit from Behaviour,
  c. just Components that inherit from MonoBehaviour, or
  d. Disable Hierarchy Icons

### Overlap Repeating Icons

1. By default, Hierarchy Icons will overlap repetitions of the same icon
2. You can disable this by un-ticking `Tools > Hierarchy Icons > Overlap Repeating Icons`
